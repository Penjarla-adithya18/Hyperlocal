            <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">13. Platform Role, User Safety &amp; Security</h2>
            <p className="mb-3">HyperLocal Jobs is an <strong>intermediary platform</strong> whose sole role is to connect Workers and Employers. We do not employ Workers, supervise job execution, or guarantee the accuracy of any user-submitted information. Accordingly:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>User responsibility:</strong> Each User is solely responsible for verifying the identity, credentials, and suitability of the other party before entering into any work arrangement. Workers should exercise personal judgment before accepting a job, and Employers should independently assess any Worker&apos;s qualifications and conduct appropriate background checks where required by their business.</li>
              <li><strong>No guarantee of authenticity:</strong> While we take steps to reduce fraudulent accounts, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of every profile, job listing, or user-submitted document. Users are advised to exercise due diligence and report suspicious activity using the in-Platform reporting tools.</li>
              <li><strong>Safety precautions:</strong> Users meet and interact at their own risk. Workers are encouraged to inform a trusted person before attending an in-person job; Employers are encouraged to conduct interviews in professional or public settings.</li>
            </ul>

              <p className="text-emerald-800 dark:text-emerald-300 font-medium mb-1">Our Multi-Layer Security Measures</p>
              <p className="text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 text-xs leading-relaxed">To build a trustworthy environment, HyperLocal Jobs provides the following safeguards:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2 text-xs text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400">
                <li><strong>PAN-based identity verification</strong> &mdash; Employers and Workers can verify their identity via PAN card, earning a visible Verified badge on their profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Score system</strong> &mdash; Each user has a dynamically calculated Trust Score based on job completion rate, ratings, account age, and verification status, giving both parties a transparent reliability signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Escrow-protected payments</strong> &mdash; Funds are held securely in escrow and released only after work completion, protecting both parties from payment fraud.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-powered fraud detection</strong> &mdash; Job listings are automatically scanned for suspicious patterns (e.g. advance fee requests, misleading descriptions) and flagged for review.</li>
                <li><strong>In-platform communication</strong> &mdash; Direct contact details are not shared until both parties connect, reducing unsolicited contact and scam risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual review system</strong> &mdash; Post-job ratings create accountability and help future users make informed decisions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2 text-xs text-emerald-700 dark:text-emerald-400 italic">These measures significantly reduce risk, but cannot eliminate it entirely. Users are encouraged to use them and report any concerns promptly.</p>
